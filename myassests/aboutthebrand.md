1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Opportunity
Patricia Pie is a Slovenian boutique couture brand with more than 10 years of presence, seven consecutive shows at Ljubljana Fashion Week and a loyal base of women who treat the brand as their long-term wardrobe partner.
In 2025, Patricia Pie enters a new chapter:
Perfect Fit – refined, signature personalization service


Ljubljana Showroom (S7) – a private couture room for one-on-one styling and fittings


In-house Atelier – full control over craftsmanship and quality in Gornja Radgona


The brand no longer pursues B2B wholesale under the Patricia Pie name; all B2B production and “no minimum order” innovation are strategically moved under the CGA (Couture Genesis Atelier) brand.
 Patricia Pie is now positioned 100% as a B2C boutique couture house.
Key Brand Strengths
Established Brand: 7 consecutive years at Ljubljana Fashion Week, consistently among the most notable shows


Proven Revenue: Approx. €100,000 annual revenue with high customer lifetime value


Unique Customer Experience: Perfect Fit service plus a private Ljubljana showroom


Strong Product DNA: Signature silhouettes, color universes and a clear Pie Philosophy for wardrobe building


In-House Craftsmanship: Own atelier with a small, highly skilled team


Strategic Positioning
Patricia Pie occupies the premium accessible luxury segment (€93–800), between mass-premium and true luxury brands.
 Target customers are sophisticated professional women aged 25–60 who value:
craftsmanship,


ethical local production,


personalization,


emotional connection to their clothes.


The differentiation comes from the combination of couture-level fit, personal relationships and a coherent wardrobe-building philosophy, supported by a physical showroom experience.
Investment & Growth Thesis
The convergence of:
demand for sustainable, long-lasting wardrobes,


desire for personalization and fit,


and exhaustion with anonymous fast fashion


creates a strong environment for Patricia Pie’s expansion.
Growth will come primarily from:
Deepening B2C revenue in Slovenia


Showroom appointments


Perfect Fit frequency


Wardrobe building with existing clients


Selective international expansion (starting with Germany – Frankfurt)


Direct clients via trunk shows, pop-up events, and targeted digital presence


No wholesale B2B; focus on direct relationships with end customers



2. BRAND FOUNDATION & PHILOSOPHY
Brand Genesis (2014)
Patricia Pie was born from Barbara Franjić’s lifelong passion for textiles and women’s confidence.
 After years in the textile industry and formal education in textile design, she chose to build her own brand despite the uncertainty and limited entrepreneurial knowledge.
The Name Story
“Patricia” – chosen as an internationally recognizable, elegant feminine name


“Pie” – a metaphor for her philosophy: just as different ingredients create a perfect pie, pieces from different Patricia Pie collections come together into a coherent, long-lasting wardrobe.


Core Values
Femininity & Confidence – every piece is designed to support a woman’s presence


Craftsmanship Excellence – maintaining and honoring Slovenian textile skills


Honest Sustainability – transparent, realistic approach to materials and production


Personal Transformation – helping women feel more like themselves


Local Pride, Global Outlook – Slovenian roots with European sensibility


Mission Statement
“To create timeless, perfectly fitted garments that empower women to feel confident, beautiful and authentically themselves, while building sustainable wardrobes that transcend seasonal trends.”

3. FOUNDER’S VISION & CREATIVE PROCESS
(This section mostly remains as in your original, lightly tightened for clarity.)
Barbara Franjić – Creative Director & Founder
Background: Textile design graduate, former industry leader in textile companies


Design Philosophy: “When I see fabric, I immediately see the garment.”


Process: Fabric-first design; inspiration from nature, travel, art and her own clients


Joy: Watching women transform when they see themselves in the mirror in a Patricia Pie piece


Inspiration sources:
Romantic nature, florals, organic forms


Vintage silhouettes from the 50s and 60s


Barbara’s own illustrations translated into prints


Real customers’ stories and needs


Slovenian textile and craft heritage



4. THE “PIE PHILOSOPHY” – CORE DIFFERENTIATION
(Concept remains, now more directly tied to showroom & Perfect Fit.)
The Pie Philosophy changes fashion from seasonal consumption to strategic wardrobe building.
Concept
Every piece is an “ingredient”.


Every collection is designed to harmonize with past and future collections.


The wardrobe evolves slowly, deliberately, and emotionally.


Practical Implementation
Color Palette: stable base colors (powder pink, camel, viola, soft neutrals), with seasonal accents that always “belong” to the core universe.


Design Continuity: recurring silhouettes, signature romantic details, consistent proportions.


Fit Philosophy: Perfect Fit principles ensure that pieces are kept and worn, not abandoned.


Customer Benefits
Long-term value, not trend-driven waste


Fewer pieces, more combinations


Emotional connection to wardrobe


Sustainable, slow fashion mindset


Business Benefits
High repeat purchases across seasons


Ability to keep core cuts active for years


Loyal customer base invested in their “pie”



5. MARKET POSITIONING & COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
Segment
Premium Accessible Luxury (€93–800)


Between mass premium and high luxury


Target
Professional, independent women 25–60


Urban / semi-urban


Sustainability-aware


Value personalization and emotional connection to fashion


(Competitors can remain as you had them; just remove B2B references.)
Unique Value Proposition
Patricia Pie is the only Slovenian premium brand that combines:
Perfect Fit personalization with 5–10 day turnaround


Private showroom experience in Ljubljana


Fabric-first couture thinking with accessible pricing


Honest sustainability and local production



6. CUSTOMER SEGMENTS & JOURNEY MAPPING
(Keep your three personas – Ana, Tina, Sara – they are excellent.
 Update journey touchpoints to include showroom & website instead of B2B.)
Key additions:
Discovery now includes:


website, showroom page, Perfect Fit content


Consideration phase:


booking showroom appointment, online inquiry, DM with Barbara


Loyalty building:


repeated showroom visits, wardrobe planning sessions



7. PRODUCT PORTFOLIO & COLLECTIONS STRATEGY
(Your structure is good and can stay with minor tweaks.)
Add explicit note:
Showroom Curation:


Ljubljana showroom always presents the freshest, most curated selection of Patricia Pie pieces, including special styles and pre-launch previews.


Digital Curation:


Website presents key looks and strong editorial storytelling, not necessarily all historically produced pieces.



8. PERFECT FIT SERVICE – OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE (UPDATED)
Perfect Fit is the core competitive advantage and central experience of the brand.
Locations
Perfect Fit can be carried out at:
Ljubljana – Showroom S7 (Stegne 7) – recommended, most intimate and focused


Zoofa boutique (Ljubljana) – when more convenient for the client


Atelier in Gornja Radgona – for clients from NE Slovenia


Also partially via video/phone consultation for pre-selection and preparation


Process Flow (3 Key Phases)
Initial Personal Consultation (30–60 min)


Preferably in the Ljubljana showroom (sofa + coffee/tea/champagne)


Warm, friendly conversation about lifestyle, body, upcoming events, preferences


First selection of pieces or fabrics


Production Phase (5–10 business days)


Garment built to ~90% completion


Barbara’s oversight, golden sample standards


Quality checks before fitting


Final Fitting & Completion


In showroom, Zoofa or atelier


Fine tuning, final adjustments


Perfect Fit guarantee


Documentation of measurements for future pieces


Differentiation
Faster than classic made-to-measure


More emotional and personal than standard RTW


Stronger wardrobe logic than one-off tailoring


(Remove all references to B2B Perfect Fit training – that now belongs to CGA.)

9. LJUBLJANA SHOWROOM – PRIVATE COUTURE EXPERIENCE (NEW CHAPTER)
Location & Atmosphere
Location: Business building S7, Stegne 7, Ljubljana


Space: ~25 m², bright, open, with:


white wall, wooden details


comfortable sofa & small table


clothing racks with latest creations


full-height mirror


separate area for trying on


Style keywords:
romantic-elegant


boutique-intimate & Paris-chic


cozy & chic, modern & clean premium


Experience
By appointment only – 1 client = 1 time slot


Barbara personally opens the door, greets warmly and takes time


Offer: coffee, tea, water, prosecco/champagne


First: relaxed conversation, then curated selection of pieces


Focus:


Perfect Fit fittings


Styling for different occasions


Wardrobe planning in line with Pie Philosophy


Preview of the newest creations


Role in the Brand
Flagship experience of Patricia Pie in Slovenia


Central place for nurturing relationships with VIP clients


Physical translation of the online brand identity


A key argument in international storytelling (“boutique couture house with private showroom”)



10. PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES & QUALITY ASSURANCE
This section largely remains valid. Emphasize:
In-house atelier in Gornja Radgona as the heart of craftsmanship


Small team = consistent quality + direct communication


Partner production used only when needed, always under Barbara’s control


Remove “500 pieces in 40 days” as a core selling point – that scalability is now more relevant to CGA. It can stay as a capability note, but not as a main growth lever here.

11. FRANKFURT & INTERNATIONAL MARKET ENTRY PLAN (UPDATED B2C)
Strategic Rationale – still Frankfurt, but Direct to Customer
Frankfurt remains the first international focus market because:
local advocate (Hanna)


strong professional female demographics


high openness to sustainable, niche European brands


Market Entry Approach – B2C Focus
Phase 1 – Foundations (Months 1–6)


German-language website version (for Patricia Pie, not CGA)


Clear explanation of Perfect Fit and showroom-style experience


Digital campaigns targeting Frankfurt region


Hanna as local connector for:


small trunk shows,


private fittings in rented spaces,


intimate presentation events.


Phase 2 – Trunk Shows & Pop-Ups (Months 7–12)


Short-term pop-up showroom events in carefully selected locations (concept store corners, boutique hotels, studios – rental, not wholesale)


Appointments only, replicating Ljubljana showroom model


Direct sales and made-to-order Perfect Fit pieces


German PR + influencer collaborations


Phase 3 – Repeat Visits & Loyalty


Return to Frankfurt 1–3 times per year


Maintain relationship through digital touchpoints, newsletter, and remote Perfect Fit follow-ups


Expand to Munich / Zurich with the same format when ready


Targets (Reframed)
Year 1 Germany (Frankfurt region):
€20,000–30,000 B2C revenue


40–60 direct clients


2–3 intimate trunk show events


Strong foundation for repeat visits and referrals


No wholesale, no dependency on boutiques under Patricia Pie.

12. DIGITAL PRESENCE & MARKETING STRATEGY (UPDATED)
Current Situation
Facebook & Instagram: ~4,200 followers, modest engagement


Website: low traffic (~20 daily visitors), underused Perfect Fit storytelling


LinkedIn: previously B2B oriented (now less relevant for Patricia Pie)


New Digital Focus
Website as Digital Showroom


Editorial design


Strong storytelling: Perfect Fit, Showroom, Atelier, Brand Story


Clear booking flow for appointments


Instagram – Main Stage


5–7 posts per week


Mix:


showroom moments,


before/after fitting feelings (without pressure),


atelier behind-the-scenes,


styling ideas (Pie Philosophy),


Frankfurt / travel diaries.


Email Marketing (VIP Layer)


Focus on existing clients and warm leads


Invitations to showroom events, first access to new pieces


German-Specific Digital Activity


German subtitles / captions for relevant content


German highlights on IG


German website version for Frankfurt clients


LinkedIn can be downscaled for Patricia Pie and used mainly for PR and media visibility rather than B2B outreach.

13. SUSTAINABILITY & ETHICS
This section is already very strong; minimal edits:
Emphasize local, small-scale, intentional production


Connect sustainability with Pie Philosophy and Perfect Fit (less waste, fewer wrong buys, long-lasting garments).



14. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & GROWTH PROJECTIONS (UPDATED DRIVERS)
Current Snapshot
Revenue: ~€100,000


Mix:


Zoofa: ~40%


Direct customers via Barbara: ~45%


Online: ~15%


30% Growth Strategy (to €130,000)
New growth drivers (without B2B):
Ljubljana Showroom & Perfect Fit: +€15,000–18,000


more appointments,


higher average order value,


deeper wardrobe building.


Germany (Frankfurt) B2C: +€10,000–12,000


trunk shows + direct orders.


Digital Optimization & Existing Customers: +€3,000–5,000


better website


better communication


more repeat purchases.


Investments:
Website redesign & system improvements: €5,000–10,000


Marketing: +€200–300 / month (focusing on IG & Germany)


Gross margins and operating margins can remain similar, with potential uplift as processes get more efficient and average order values rise through styling and wardrobe planning.

15. RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION (UPDATED)
Remove B2B-specific risks (e.g. partner credit risk) and focus on:
Founder Dependency:


Mitigation: better systems, small support team, structured appointment calendar.


Capacity Limits:


Mitigation: controlled growth, careful scheduling, use of atelier capacity sensibly.


Market Entry Complexity (Germany):


Mitigation: trunk-show approach instead of fixed retail; low fixed costs; test & learn.


Economic Downturn:


Mitigation: emphasize investment pieces, price ladder, and wardrobe building; loyalty focus.

Warm Professional


Authentically Confident


Romantic but Practical


Local Soul, European Vision


Tone of Voice – B2C
Encouraging, intimate, never intimidating


Focus on feelings, transformation, confidence


Transparent about process, pricing, timeframes


No hard selling – more “inviting” than “pushing”
