Barbara Franjić is the founder and head designer of Patricia Pie, a boutique couture brand that has been shaping a distinctly romantic, feminine universe since 2011. Her relationship with clothing started in childhood as a quiet fascination with fabrics and form, and later evolved into a conscious decision to dedicate her life to design.
After completing the Secondary Textile School in Ljubljana (Textile Technician programme), Barbara continued her studies at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, University of Maribor, specialising in Textile and Clothing Design. There she deepened her understanding of materials, construction and pattern cutting. She began her professional path in leading roles within larger textile companies, but soon realised that her true passion lay in a more intimate, boutique approach to clothing and the women who wear it. This led to the birth of Patricia Pie in 2011, initially as a small, author-driven label in which Barbara herself created the majority of the pieces.
Her signature style is romantic, feminine and gentle, characterised by soft silhouettes, a defined waist and A-line shapes, blending a subtle nostalgia for the 1950s and 1960s with a modern, delicately dramatic mood. Patricia Pie garments are designed as a cohesive wardrobe for real life – for work, evening and special occasions – rather than as fast-fashion trends or costumes for social media.
A major milestone came in 2023, when Barbara opened her own atelier in Gornja Radgona. The atelier is the working home of her team – a place where ideas are turned into wearable pieces every day – and the boutique workshop where all Patricia Pie collections and Perfect Fit garments are made. Perfect Fit has been part of Barbara’s philosophy from the very beginning: it means adapting her original Patricia Pie designs precisely to the client’s measurements. It is not about reproducing dresses “from a picture”, but about creating garments within her own design language that truly follow the woman’s body and life.
From 2017 to 2025, Patricia Pie has been presented eight seasons in a row at Ljubljana Fashion Week, and Barbara’s work is regularly covered by major Slovenian fashion and lifestyle media. The brand operates with a small-scale, local production model, avoiding mass manufacturing. Collections are created in small batches, designed to be worn for years, and Barbara actively encourages alterations, adjustments and repairs of her own pieces to extend their life and deepen the relationship with each client.
Another important part of her vision is supporting the next generation of designers. In her Gornja Radgona atelier, Barbara works with young designers from Slovenia and across the EU, helping them with pattern development, prototypes and small series. As she often says, she wants to provide young creatives with the support she herself frequently lacked at the beginning of her journey.
Through this blend of technical knowledge, craftsmanship, romantic aesthetics and an empathetic, human approach, Barbara Franjić has built Patricia Pie into a brand where clothing becomes an extension of personality rather than a temporary costume.
